This research page gathers together various types of popups into one collection. It would likely be sensible to break these popup types down further into separate Open UI components. That said, despite some semantic and nomenclature differences, various types of popups tend to share common themes as far as styling/positioning; user input behaviors; and semantic relationships with other elements. One standardized HTML element may be sufficient to cover the vast majority of popups, so long as this element can be customized with other HTML/CSS primitives and ARIA attributes where appropriate.
